Built in with a secure login system will keep your blogs safe from unwanted snoopers. 

Forgot your password ? Don't stress it out ! 
The CMS comes with a reset password system easy to use as well. All you need to do is to have your Secret Word at hand and voila. 

Password Successfully reset! 

And if you forgot your Secret Word, we can always remind you as there is a built it reminder system too.

## Why is it ?

Out of curiosity and skill training.

To get a better understanding on how a CMS works under the hood, but also to improve my PHP and MySQL skills too I decided to build this blog CMS with as many features possible making it feel like a complete product.
